This android application is used for the online game, League of Legends. The 
app will use a player name (input from user), and will take real time data 
from the site, www.lolteam.net, to display information of the games that 
are in progress.

Currently, we have some code which we hope to improve upon (Rule of Economy). 
In addition to adding more features, we hope to clean up the code and make it 
more modular (Rule of Modularity and Rule of Transparency). We will be testing 
the code on our android devices to prototype and polish the current and new 
features (Rule of Optimization).
